            <h5 class="infoDesc margintop4">He's been an athlete his entire life, always 
                pushing himself to meet people and get on their good side before he shows them
                his moves on the court. He'll always be equipped with a smile 
                and ready to compete whether it be in sports or developing software,
                whichever; the fun will surely rub off onto everyone around him. Running up
                the mountains and hiking the dirtiest trails is what he does, swimming and 
                biking are his personal choice of transportation. This is all a beginning 
                to his adventures into meeting new beautiful people and going on journeys 
                to expand his knowledge.</h5>
